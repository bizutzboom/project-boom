                <h1>Giannis Antetokounmpo "You Can Be A Freak On The Court"</h1>
                <p>Giannis Antetokoúnmpo born December 6, 1994 in Zográfou in the suburbs of Athens in Greece, is a Greek professional basketball player. Nicknamed the “Greek Freak” (the Greek Monster), he has been playing as a strong winger or even pivot in the Milwaukee Bucks since 2013, in the National Basketball Association (NBA).
                    During the 2016-2017 season, he led the Bucks in five major statistical categories1 and became the first player in NBA history to finish a regular season in the top 20 in all five statistics: points, rebounds, assists, interceptions and blocks2. He received the title of Most Improved Player (best progression) in 20173.
                    Selected seven times in the NBA All-Star Game, he was twice elected NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the regular season in 2019 and 2020. He was elected NBA Defensive Player of the Year (defender of the year) during the 2019-2020 season and named Athlete of the Year at the 2019 ESPY Awards.
                    In the 2020-2021 season, Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks won the NBA title. Giannis Antetokounmpo was voted Finals MVP thanks to his performances, notably with fifty points scored in the decisive Game 6 of the Final against the Phoenix Suns. Against the Boston Celtics in the 2022 playoffs, he becomes the first player in history to accumulate at least 200 points, 100 rebounds and 50 assists in a series then at the end of the season, the Greek becomes the first and only player to be voted unanimously four times in a row to the All-NBA First Team. He is the leading scorer, passer and blocker in Bucks history.</p>
