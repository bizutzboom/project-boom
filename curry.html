                <h1>Steph Curry "The Splash Brother"</h1>
                <p>Stephen Curry, born March 14, 1988 in Akron (Ohio, United States), is an American basketball player playing as a point guard for the Golden State Warriors in the NBA.Renowned for his three-point shooting skills, he is the player with the most three-pointers in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 and is considered the best shooter in NBA history. Recruited into the NBA in 2009, he suffered an injury in the summer of 2011 and was forced to miss a large part of the 2011-2012 season. He revealed himself during the following season as one of the best point guards in the league. During the 2014-2015 season, he achieved international recognition by obtaining the title of NBA champion with his team – which he also won in 2017, 2018 and 2022 – as well as the trophy for best player of the season. The following season, he received his second MVP title of the season, after setting a new regular season winning record with his team. On April 13, 2021, he became the all-time leading scorer for the Golden State Warriors, surpassing Wilt Chamberlain4. Since December 14, 2021 at Madison Square Garden in New York, he has held the NBA record for the number of career three-point baskets, thus dethroning Ray Allen5. In June 2022, he won the fourth NBA championship title of his career with his team as well as his first Finals MVP title.
                    He is the son of former basketball player Dell Curry, who notably played for the Charlotte Hornets, and the brother of Seth Curry, who currently plays for the Brooklyn Nets. With his teammate Klay Thompson, he forms a duo nicknamed "Splash Brothers", in reference to their great shooting skills.</p>
